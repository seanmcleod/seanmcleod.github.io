      <title>Camera Tracking of Aircraft Control Positions</title>

      <description>The standard method of tracking the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s control positions as the pilot moves the controls for flight test instrumentation (FTI) purposes is to attach string potentiometers (string pots) to the control cables/rods. As the control cable/rod moves based on the pilot&amp;rsquo;s inputs a spring loaded thin steel wire is reeled in or out of the string pot.</description>

      <title>Extra 300 Spin</title>

      <description>This is an example of the data collected by my Homebrew FTI (Flight Test Instrumentation) system during a spin in an Extra-300.
The control positions were tracked using a camera based tracking system that I developed and the output from the camera tracking units were fed into the FTI unit.</description>

      <description>I first got involved in designing FTI equipment in 2008 when TFASA (Test Flying Academy of South Africa) asked me to design some FTI equipment to be used in a Hawker Hunter jet that they were using for a course they were running. I did a write-up on this work in - Geeks and Fast Jets.</description>

      <title>Landing - Ground Effect, Flare - JSBSim</title>

      <description>Taking a look at the ground effect and the flare on landing performance using JSBSim to see it&amp;rsquo;s effect on the final sink rate and the change in airspeed.
For this test I&amp;rsquo;m using the Boeing 737 model included with JSBSim. The aircraft is setup and trimmed at 150ft AGL with a speed of 140kt IAS and on a 3 degree flight path with the flaps and gear down.</description>

      <title>Pitch Rate Damping - JSBSim Test</title>

      <description>When an aircraft pitches up or down the tailplane rotates around the cg of the aircraft and this motion causes a change in the tailplane&amp;rsquo;s angle of attack, which generates a change in lift at the tailplane. This change in lift at the tailplane in conjunction with the tailplane&amp;rsquo;s arm from the cg generates an opposing, or damping, pitching moment.</description>

      <title>Max Q - Maximum Dynamic Pressure</title>

      <description>During a rocket launch the commentator will often call out &amp;ldquo;Max Q&amp;rdquo; at a specific point in time during the launch. This is the point at which the dynamic pressure acting on the rocket will be at it&amp;rsquo;s maximum.
The dynamic pressure or Q is the product of the air-density and the velocity squared of the object travelling through the air.</description>

      <title>Modelica - Simple Rocket Test</title>

      <description>In the mid 1980s while I was in high school my father bought me an Apple II, well actually a clone of an Apple II from Hong Kong. He had been a helicopter pilot in the air force and had then become an airline pilot, hence the Hong Kong connection.</description>

      <description>I was approached recently to help develop some Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) for a Hawker Hunter jet to be used during a test pilot course involving high angle of attack manoeuvres and spinning.
The following data needed to be recorded:
 Angle of Attack (AoA) Angle of Sideslipe (AoS) Attitude (pitch, roll and heading) Indicated airspeed and altitude Stick and rudder position GPS Video  In addition to recording all the data listed above they also wanted to display a subset of the data in the cockpit as an aid for spin recovery.</description>
