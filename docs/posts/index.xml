      <description>The standard method of tracking the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s control positions as the pilot moves the controls for flight test instrumentation (FTI) purposes is to attach string potentiometers (string pots) to the control cables/rods. As the control cable/rod moves based on the pilot&amp;rsquo;s inputs a spring loaded thin steel wire is reeled in or out of the string pot.</description>

      <title>Extra 300 Spin</title>

      <description>This is an example of the data collected by my Homebrew FTI (Flight Test Instrumentation) system during a spin in an Extra-300.
The control positions were tracked using a camera based tracking system that I developed and the output from the camera tracking units were fed into the FTI unit.</description>

      <title>Max Q - Maximum Dynamic Pressure</title>

      <description>During a rocket launch the commentator will often call out &amp;ldquo;Max Q&amp;rdquo; at a specific point in time during the launch. This is the point at which the dynamic pressure acting on the rocket will be at it&amp;rsquo;s maximum.
The dynamic pressure or Q is the product of the air-density and the velocity squared of the object travelling through the air.</description>

      <description>I was approached recently to help develop some Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) for a Hawker Hunter jet to be used during a test pilot course involving high angle of attack manoeuvres and spinning.
The following data needed to be recorded:
 Angle of Attack (AoA) Angle of Sideslipe (AoS) Attitude (pitch, roll and heading) Indicated airspeed and altitude Stick and rudder position GPS Video  In addition to recording all the data listed above they also wanted to display a subset of the data in the cockpit as an aid for spin recovery.</description>
