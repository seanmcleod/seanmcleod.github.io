    <p>I first got involved in designing FTI equipment in 2008 when TFASA (Test Flying Academy of South Africa)
asked me to design some FTI equipment to be used in a Hawker Hunter jet that they were using for a course
they were running. I did a write-up on this work in - <a href="https://seanmcleod.github.io/2008/06/geeks-and-fast-jets/">Geeks and Fast Jets</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequent to that work I developed a couple of follow up FTI units that TFASA have used over the years on
various types of aircraft when running test pilot training courses.</p>
<p>The first FTI unit in the Hawker Hunter used a ruggedized PC as the FTI unit to collect data and log it
from various sensors and to provide a real display in the cockpit.</p>
<p>For the follow-up unit which needed to be installed on much smaller aircraft where space, weight and
power requirements were smaller I switched to a simple SBC (Single Board Computer) called the Fez Rhino.
The Fez Rhino ran a small embedded version of the .Net (Common Language Runtime - CLR) runtime.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/fezrhino.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>Sensors were connected via a combination of serial inputs and analog inputs. For a later iteration I switched
to the Fez Hydra which was similar in terms of running an embedded version of .Net just with a slightly more
powerful CPU and a different physical connector setup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/fezhydra.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>Here is a photo of one of the Fez Hydra based FTI units with a test harness to test the 16 analog inputs,
6 digital inputs and 3 serial ports.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/fezhydrafti.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>The one serial port was always connected to a Rockwell-Collins ADAHRS unit as shown below. The unit provided
air data in terms of airspeed and pressure altitude plus attitude and heading (AHRS) information from a set
of 3-axis gyros, accelerometers and magnetometers and in addition GPS information.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/rockwellcollinsadahrs.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>Data was logged to an SD card for downloading after the flight and in-flight one of the serial ports could be
connected to a Windows CE device called the Oudie to display real-time data and graphs to the test pilot instructor
and student.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/oudie.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>For the third and current iteration of the FTI package we wanted a more portable system that didn&rsquo;t need as much
wiring to the ADAHRS+GPS sensor and not having to get power from the aircraft. This enables us to quickly install
and remove the system from different aircraft.</p>
<p>Instead of using an off-the-shelf SBC like the Fez Hydra I contracted the design of a custom SBC from John Baxter
who I knew via mutual work colleagues. He designed a custom PCB with an Amtel micro-CPU plus a battery charging
circuit and a WiFi module.</p>
<p>The unit includes the Rockwell-Collins ADAHRS+GPS unit mounted inside our case on top of a lead plate plus
rechargeable batteries and the custom SBC.</p>
<p>The portable FTI unit mounted in a Cessna C-172.</p>
<p><img src="/images/homebrew-fti/portableftiunit.png" alt="image alt text"></p>
<p>The updated in-cockpit application now running on an Android based tablet receives the data via the WiFi connection to
display the real-time data including graphs and to record the data for processing and playback after landing on a PC.</p>
