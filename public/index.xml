      <description>I was approached recently to help develop some Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) for a Hawker Hunter jet to be used during a test pilot course involving high angle of attack manoeuvres and spinning.
The following data needed to be recorded:
 Angle of Attack (AoA) Angle of Sideslipe (AoS) Attitude (pitch, roll and heading) Indicated airspeed and altitude Stick and rudder position GPS Video  In addition to recording all the data listed above they also wanted to display a subset of the data in the cockpit as an aid for spin recovery.</description>
