I started playing around with generating HDR photos. Here is one of my first attempts using our Pentax DSLR.

I'm using a trial version of Photomatix to perform the HDR processing and tone mapping which is why you'll notice 
their watermark in the HDR image below.

I set the auto-bracketing option on the camera to shoot a normal exposure, a -2 stop exposure and a +2 stop exposure.

This is the resultant HDR image.

Next up is the camera's normal exposure, so effectively what you would end up with if you weren't doing any HDR processing. 
Camera selected f/9.5 and 1/60 sec.

Now the -2 stop image, so f/9.5 1/250 sec.

And lastly the +2 stop image, so f/9.5 1/15 sec.
