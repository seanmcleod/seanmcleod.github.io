As I mentioned in my [previous post](/2005/11/virtual-earth-media-center-add-in/) I 
have a basic Virtual Earth add-in for Windows Media Center that works within the Media 
Center UI and is usable with the remote control.

I've now added support for integrating geocoded pictures with the Virtual Earth add-in. 
So next time someone asks you where a particular photo was taken while watching a 
slide show you can pop-up the Virtual Earth add-in which will center the map on the 
photo's location and show a pushpin on the map. This functionality relies on the 
availability of GPS coordinates in the digital image.
 
There are a number of software packages available that will tag your digital photos 
with GPS coordinates using either an associated GPS track or allowing you to manually 
enter the coordinates.
 
For more details, screenshots, download and source code see the article I wrote 
up on [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12202/Virtual-Earth-Media-Center-Add-in).
